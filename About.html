        <li>The philosophical viewpoint of the Food and Drug Administration is that they would prefer to see industries bring their plants into compliance voluntarily rather than to force compliance through FDA action.</li>
        <li>The government rarely takes legal action against a processor without first making an inspection. The simplest examples are the finding of food products containing whole insects, very large fragments, whole rodent pellets or hairs, or in general, extraneous matter characterized by large size, indicating that the filth did not come from the raw ingredients.</li>
